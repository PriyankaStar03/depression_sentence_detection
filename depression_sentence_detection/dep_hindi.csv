May we all make a collective resolution this year to help keep one another in the light. 
You never know what's in their mind
Always lend an ear or give a hug...no matter if you think it's impossible for a particular person to harm themselves
everyday is a struggle but you’ve learned to do it with a smile on your face
Some souls are too pure for this world
"Having survived, it shocks me at who wants to help and who look to villainize me because of it"
"this is always how I understood ""silence like a cancer grows""."
if someone doesn't want to live then You should value what time you do have with them
My story scares me and no one cares.
Real depreesion is when you stop loving the things you love
"I need a break from my brain, my heart, my life."
Mental health day is every single day
No amount of guilt can change the past and no amount of anxiety can change the future
It’s never too late to rewrite your story….Get up & turn that page!
"In future after proper studies, we may need antibiotics to treat gut bacteria"
Do you want forgiveness - Finding True Peace Campaign 
Just because you don't have it doesn't mean it does not exist.
" Think deep, never ridicule those living with it"
Why he says people need to stop saying that mental health is a joke.
There are a lot of reasons I don't show my face in pics.
Been feeling lower than usual over the last few weeks
You will never be able to escape from your heart.
It is better to listen to what it has to say.
Childhood trauma shapes who you are
IT IS NOT YOUR OUTSIDE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DETERMINE YOUR FUTURE. 
2023 is about taking risks for me.
I don't think god is really finished with us until our chief delight is god alone.
If you live in fear of the future beacause of what happened in your past.
You will end up losing what you have in the present.
 Want to do something to support them but not sure how?
I never got back more of my head this week.
Feeling so down today.
I have no motivation to do anything .
So that means we are not even allowed to breakup with a girl.
"""If there is a God, why has he let me down?"""
What I needed was someone to come down to the pit with me.
Older adults just keep themselfs isolated because nobody understands
Working on getting myself out of this deep mood valley
it's a struggle to even just get out of bed.
Healing Childhood Emotional Abuse with Mindfulness Meditation
Just imagine being bombarded by unpleasant and loud noise day after day until the point where you can't take it anymore
It takes STRENGTH to fight an invisible enemy day after day.
Never EVER give up hope. You are not alone. 
makes me wonder how many people have forgotten about me
if they did then you are better off without them.
My life can’t get much sadder than this… 
"Darkness, my only friend… You’re the only one who lives rent free in my head."
"A mirage of light in the distance, while staring at a sea of darkness"
Moonlight is my only friend now.
This time of year sucks
Thepast can't be changed.
Everyone's journey is different.
Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up being the biggest step of your life.
Mindfulness is paying attention in this moment on purpose without judgment.
"Train your mind to make ""right choice"""
Discover who is the most compatible with you
everything feels bleak and hopeless
Perhaps the darkness in this world wants to take us all away and it festers till the light can no longer be enough alone
Slowly starting to find myself and the confidence
"This is not something you can control alone, so do not sorry!"
It’s like the tears of a clown when no one’s around..
It is a fight every single day just to exist for one more. 
No one honestly cares what someone is going through until they are gone. 
"many people ""seem"" happy because they are taught ""fake it till you make it"""
I don't have any fight left in me.
I would say you played a huge part in causing it!
Keeping people in fear for a start.
"I miss last year, I wish I could go back"
Loneliness is a disease of the 21st century in highly developed countries
"I sleep a lot because I'm on the edge all the time, not because I'm lazy... I'm sick of people thinking it's funny."
I have no motivation to do anything and want to cry all the time.
I am in a pitt of darkness that I have made.
I see no sunshine only pitch black darkness.
So tired of being me … I am exhausted 
Reminder to talk to yourself like you would a friend
Feeling lost.Don’t know why
"For me - Every day, like a little funeral, TBH."
There is no desire to me to live in this reality.
Yeah that’s where the church failed my friend
my life sucks and i want to die
I wish I understood my more. It would save me alot of heartbreak.
I make suicidal jokes cuz I am the suicidal joke lmao
Mind strength is underrated my friend. Life is too short.
I m commiting suicide there is NO HOPE
I'm past midnight crying about my life and for the 1st time in a long time I feel i'm not the only one struggling with something
"Music speaks a thousand words, but sometimes none can express the sorrow of a broken heart"
When the sun peeps out for a minute and I realize I'm not actually morbidly
"everything i was afraid of happening, happened"
Please look out for people who may be suffering. They're trying to find a way out of a hellish maze with no end. 
"This is the book they want to hide from us, they dont want to see us happy and healthy"
nothing is working out the way I want it to today 
I'm Writer without a reader.
It's a terrible situation when you're happy and sad all at the same time.
"You may think your child is happy, but are they?"
A negative mind will never give you a positive life
I'm such a waste of life. Who'd even miss m if I was gone? 
I just don’t know where my heads at! What’s wrong with me
Everything to me is a escape from reality 
"Well I guess you have to decide then, breaking up or being together."
"many people facing our current situation, still keep silent or simply show with acts don't care about it at all."
Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad
Why is it you can be around people yet still feel so isolated?
It's like a deep loneliness that's hard to pin point - even with the most well meaning people around.
2022 worst year my life i always hate this year
Don't know why I feel uneasy now it's like I'm just breathing nothing much.
Scared of future being a failure it's like everything is going to falling apart.
"How I Stayed Alive When My Brain Was Trying to Kill Me. It’s ok to have suicidal thoughts, just don’t act on them."
i want to hide for the rest of my life 
I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore
Have you ever felt sad after being actually happy for a while and it's like you're drowning again? 
I need more friends. anyone else lonley?
"I know I'm lost, and I want him to come find me. And now, the question is: Would he?"
He didn't come i am waiting ....
A Horror Game Where Your Only Friend Is A Large Spider ...
I still feel alone and lost like no one notices me
hey siri … how do i tell someone i need help without actually telling them i need help?
"Perhaps, to understand, you have to have 'been there'."
"i broke my principles for him. I compromised,hoeever, he still chose to lie and kept secrets from me...."
Finally put my life insurance into my mom’s name so no one get 300k when I die. Now I can be in peace for the newyear.
If people only realized and understood how much I actually hate myself….then maybe someone would care a little bit
सपने ही है जिनकी वजह से मैं जी रहा हूँ वरना जीने की कोई उम्मीद ही नहीं
Men go through so much pain that they will never talk about it because they know that nobody cares.
All we do is try to survive.
I found so many horrible stories. Very little good news.
the sun is a memory fog devours it all
No-one of any significance has been held accountable!
Yet Life certainly requires you to pay for your life?
"I sat alone in my car with my head in my hands, wondering how I ended up"
"Soon, I'll be called the bad one."
Only you have to fight for yourself
"You don't always have to tell your side of story, but time will"
Some love stories don't have a beautiful endings everytime it may ends with some precious one's death
"there's so much I want to tell you, but can't"
Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not
 you feel like you’re really alone
Mental pain is less dramatic than physical pain
it is easier to say “My tooth is aching” than to say “My heart is broken.
one day or brief time of happiness does not make a person entirely happy.
 It’s hard to be a friend
I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me
It is very hard to explain to people
 it’s that cold absence of feeling—that really hollowed-out feeling.
The sun stopped shining for me is all
"It’s a battle you fight every day. You never stop, never get to rest."
I wish you could hear all the words I’m too afraid to say.
"Behind my smile is a hurting heart, behind my laugh I’m falling apart."
"Look closely at me and you will see, the girl I am, it isn’t me."
I really want to talk to someone about my thoughts and feelings but I can’t.
"There is hope, even when your brain tells you there isn’t."
Listen closely to the songs I play because the lyrics speak the words I fail to say.
They tell me I’m not trying but how would they know.
I wish I didn’t care all the time.
I don’t think people realize how much strength it takes to pull your own self out of a dark place mentally.
The challenge is to look them in the eye and see their smile
"I think the reason why I get upset so quickly is that I would never do the things people do to hurt me, to hurt them."
"I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness for it shows me the stars. "
The worst kind of sadness is not being able to explain why. 
There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds.
I don’t think people understand how stressful it is to explain what’s going on in your head
You are allowed to feel messed up and inside out. 
"I know I’ve been smiling, but inside I’m dying."
 There will always be dark days. 
I already know I’m not good enough.
Sleeping is so hard when you can’t stop thinking.
I say sorry a lot because I secretly feel that everything is my fault.
Behind my pretty smile is a story you’ll never understand.
No person can hate me more than I can hate myself.
So many words to say and no way to say them.
The worst sadness is the sadness you’ve taught yourself to hide.
My biggest problem is overthinking everything.
Everything is changing and I don’t know where I fit anymore.
You will never understand the hell I feel inside my head. 
The perfect is the enemy of the good. 
"I hate this feeling like I’m here, but I’m not. "
"Sleep isn’t just sleeping anymore, it’s an escape. "
Every thought is a battle. Every breath is a war. And I don’t think I am winning anymore. 
I’m exhausted from trying to be stronger than I feel.
Mental illness is so much more complicated than any pill that any mortal could invent.
I lost myself somewhere in the darkness
I may have looked happy but inside I was hopelessly depressed.
 the world is full of suffering
"Pain changes people, it makes them trust less, overthink more, and shut people out."
I’ll never forget how the loneliness felt good and bad at the same time.
"I think I’m afraid to be happy because whenever I get too happy, something bad always happens."
There are some things about myself I can’t explain to anyone.
There are some things I don’t understand at all.
A depressing and difficult passage has prefaced every page I have turned in life
I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me
I didn’t want to wake up
I am terrified by this dark thing that sleeps in me
It’s not always the tears that measure the pain. Sometimes it’s the smile we fake.
 The worst thing is to lose your reason for living.
"Sometimes, all you can do is lie in bed and hope to fall asleep before you fall apart. "
She’s battling things her smile will never tell you about.
the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy
Losing your life is not the worst thing that can happen.
I don’t hate people. I just feel better when they aren’t around.
It’s such a fine line between feeling everything and nothing at all.
They say “follow your heart” but if your heart is in a millon pieces which piece do you follow?
" you hold so much sadness in your eyes, I can almost touch the scars of your soul and cry."
Angry is just sad’s bodyguard.
Make peace with your broken pieces.
You have to die a few times before you can really live
"She has love in her words, pain in her silence"
My heart hides so many wounds that never bleed
"Just because you carry it well, doesn’t mean it’s not heavy."
Life is way too short to spend it at war with yourself.
The bravest thing I ever did was continuing my life when I wanted to die
The real reasons for not committing suicide is because you always know how swell life gets again after the hell is over
"If you are going through hell, keep going"
If this is how my is going to be I don't want it anymore.
And something inside me just.. Broke.. That's the only way I could describe it
Stop pretending you care about me
It's always worse than it seems
Stop asking if I'm ok. I'm tired of lying.
Recovery is not a competition.
I have friends but why do I feel soo alone?
My biggest fear is that eventually you will see me the way I see myself
"I tell people I'll be fine tomorrow but I know, tomorroe will be worse."
"I tell lie everyday and I know, I'll not be able to stop it by myself"
There is a hell believe me I've seen it.
I hate watching myself. It's terrible. It's horrifying.
"It's hard to answer the question ""What's wrong?"" when nothing's right."
Treat me like a joke and I'll leave you like it's fuuny.
"People who die by suicide don't want to end their lives, they want to end teir pain."
"It seems everyone I get close to, ends up forgetting me."
"Youwas the most important person in my life, and you ruined me."
"Once the heart gets too heavy with pain, people don't cry."
Tears comes from the heart and not from the brain.
"The diffrence between you and me is that when you wake up, ypur nughtmare ends."
Suicide ends the pain you could never escape from.
Things change. And friends leave.
"A broken heart is where God comes to live in. If not, I wonder hoe it still beats."
"The soul which has no fixed purpose in life is lost, to be everywhere, is to  be nowhere."
Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.
i feel like a miserable piece of garbage
i feel so worthless during those times i was struggling finding work
i feel like throwing away the shitty piece of shit paper
"When people don’t know exactly what happens, they can be judgmental"
often times we call a man cold when he is only sad
"When you’re surrounded by all these people, it can be lonelier than when you’re by yourself."
Mental pain is more common and also more hard to bear
"One swallow does not make a summer, neither does one fine day"
I saw the world in black and white instead of the vibrant colors and shades I knew existed.
I woke up into a nightmare.
"The absence of hope. That very deadened feeling, which is so very different from feeling sad."
You don’t have to live a lie
Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul?
Crying is one of the highest devotional songs
"I have had to experience so much stupidity, vices, error, nausea, disillusionment and sorrow."
"Some friends don’t understand how desperate I am to have someone say, I love you and I support you just the way you are"
They don’t understand that I can’t remember anyone ever saying good thing to me. 
Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do
I am sad all the time and the sadness is so heavy that I can’t get away from it. Not ever.
Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.
You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness
To have felt too much is to end in feeling nothing
"People keep telling me that life goes on, but to me that’s the saddest part."
It's sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.
Life's under no obligation to give us what we expect.
Sometimes you've got to be able to listen to yourself and be okay with no one else understanding
One thing you can't hide — is when you're crippled inside.
Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.
"Every life has a measure of sorrow, and sometimes this is what awakens us."
"Every human walks around with a certain kind of sadness. They may not wear it on their sleeves, but it's there if you look deep."
Sometimes it’s better to leave them broken than try to hurt yourself putting it back together
"It is sad not to love, but it is much sadder not to be able to love."
"There is a time for departure, even when there’s no certain place to go"
"For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, ‘It might have been"
The prettiest smile hide the deepest secrets.
Sometimes it’s better to be alone. Nobody can hurt you…
Time doesn't really heal the heart.
Life teaches the hardest lessons to the softest hearts.
The people we love the most hurt the deepest.
Don't cry over someone who wouldn't cry over you
"Behind every sweet smile, there is a bitter sadness that no one can ever see and feel."
In deep sadness there is no place for sentimentality
"We never taste happiness in perfection, our most fortunate successes are mixed with sadness"
It doesn’t hurt to feel sad from time to time.
The worst feeling is wanting to cry but having to hold it in because you are in public.
And suddenly life wasn't about living it was about surviving.
I don't think anyone realy understands how tiring it is to act okay and always be strong.
It's not always just the heart. Sometimes your mind breaks as well.
I'm sad but I smile. That's my life.
I can wipe the tears in my eyes but I can't wipe the pain in my heart.
All the clouds in me are raining.
"You've become so damaged that when osmeone tries to give you what you deserve, you have no idea how to response."
Nobody notices how hard I try to hold back my tears everyday.
I'm not even a person anymore. I'm just stress and sadness.
How much pain do you have to go through until giving up?
I wasn't myself for months and nobody noticed.
I just have this happy personality and a sad soul in one body. 
"I'm stuck between trying to live my life, and trying to run from it."
I'm slowly giving up.
My head is currently a horrible place to be.
Save me from the nothing I've become.
Do you ever feel you're not even friends with your friends.
I need a break from my own thoughts.
I'll never be that mme again.
You keep a lot to yourself because it's difficult to find people who understand.
"I'm gonna go nap. I'm not tired, I just don't want to be awake."
Faking a smiel is so much easier than explaining why are you sad.
Sometimes the worst place you can be is in your own head.
"You let people in, and they destroy you."
I even overthink my overthinking.
That's the problem with being the strong one. No one offers you a hand.
I noticed everything. I just acted like I didn't.
The eyes is useless when the mind is blind.
"If you don't understand my silence, how will you understand my words?"
"Why is everything I do, wrong?"
I'm not as okay as I pretend to be.
I destroy everything I touch.
Sometime surviving is the worst kind of pain.
I'm not okay but it's okay.
"If you feel everything intensely, ultimately, you feel nothing at all. "
"I wanted to talk about it. Damn it. I wanted to scream. I wanted to yell. I wanted to shout about it. But all I could do was whisper, “I’m fine.”"
It’s not always the tears that measure the pain. Sometimes it’s the smile we fake. 
I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless
I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full.
"I believe that words are strong, that they can overwhelm what we fear when fear seems more awful than life is good."
Understanding the difference between healthy striving and perfectionism is critical to laying down the shield and picking up your life
All it takes is a beautiful fake smile to hide an injured soul and they will never notice how broken you really are.
"Bruise in your mind. You just got to be careful not to touch it where it hurts. It’s always there, though."
I wanted to kill someone and I wanted to die and I wanted to run as far and as fast as I could
There’s death all around us. Everywhere we look. 1.8 people kill themselves every second. We just don’t pay attention. Until we do.
This is what it felt like to have a broken heart. It felt less like a cracking down the middle.
"The sun kept on with its slipping away, and I thought how many small good things in the world might be resting on the shoulders of something terrible."
I wonder how it is possible to hurt so much when nothing is wrong.
And sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you can’t forgive yourself for.
Have you ever wondered what a human life is worth?
Sometimes pain is so unmanageable that the idea of spending another day with it seems impossible. 
"A lot of you cared, just not enough."
"Long time I been on my own, but now really I’m alone."
I don’t know if it’s possible to take hate away from people.
It’s raining in my heart like it’s raining in the city. What is this sadness that pierces my heart?
"Grief is not as heavy as guilt, but it takes more away from you."
"Even when I try to stir myself up, I just get irritated because I can’t make anything come out."
There isn’t a single strong emotion inside me.
You begin to forget what it means to live.
I don’t want to see anyone.
Whatever is happening to me is my own fault.
I have done something wrong. Something so huge I can’t even see it.
If you’ve been up all night and cried till you have no more tears left in you
"Just because you can’t see mental illness like you could see a broken bone, doesn’t mean it’s not as detrimental "
She’s battling things her smile will never tell you about.
It’s such a fine line between feeling everything and nothing at all.
"My darling, you hold so much sadness in your eyes, I can almost touch the scars of your soul and cry."
I am lonely in places I didn’t even know existed inside me
The real reasons for not committing suicide is because you always know how swell life gets again after the hell is over.”
Your pain is an opportunity for you to learn about yourself.
